# Star-Fox-Viona
A WIP ROM Hack of Star Fox for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. All Star Fox copyrights still go to Nintendo!

I will not upload an actual ROM to hopefully not 

** /!\ WARNING: THIS ROM HACK FEATURES MY OCs! DON'T STEAL THEM! /!\ **

If you have been following me for the past month or so, you may have noticed i've gotten to like Star Fox.
I'm currently working on a ROM Hack for the SNES Version of the game, which will replace Fox and friends (and their dialogue) with some of my original characters. I'll try to make it in-line with my upcoming animation "Airborne"

This repository will NOT contain any distrubution of the Star Fox ROM, or the necessary MS-DOS applications needed for compilation.
I don't want to have a boss fight with Nintendo.

# Current Characters

-Axl:
Axl is a very friendly wolf with a liking for retro stuff. He has a strong sense of what's right, and what's wrong!

![jclose](https://github.com/YourPalAxl/Star-Fox-Viona/assets/141529299/bb9a7bac-9bd3-4ded-bc9d-b35301a18ebf)


-Justine:
Justine is a white cat who has been at Axl's side since those... dark days... Her and Axl's friendship is very strong! She is very caring as a person, she'll not leave your side if she catches you being upset.

-Ryan:
Ryan is a lynx who faught his way to safety with Axl and Justine, and is considered family by them.

-Mallow (Most probably a temporary character):
Mallow is the most peculiar of the bunch... Mallow is a fox... made entirely out of marshmallow slime.. Don't let this scare you though! She's not some 80s horror movie monster. She's actaully the glue of the team. If you're worried about her ship, don't worry! It's been modified so it keeps as it's top performance, no matter where her goo ends up in it! Peculiar character I know, but at least it's something.
(If no character has been made/thought of to replace Mallow, then Mallow will keep the spot.)


# Requirements for compilation:
Please make sure you've got the following:
* A computer running MS-DOS 5.00 and above (You may try running the programs in other versions of MS-DOS, but i can't guarantee stability, as i've not tested this. DOSBox may also work. This will NOT work in Windows NT versions, and i have yet to test it on Windows 9X / 3.1.)
* Argonaut Software's compiler software (This is not provided for reasons you should be aware of, but UltraStarFox should have it)
* An SNES or at least an emulator. (This will create an SNES .SFC ROM upon successful compilation. You may get a checksum error. this is totally normal!)

# To-Do:
* ~~Implement the crosshair view seen in the asteroid levels fully across all levels, replacing the view you can switch to by pressing SELECT~~ ***COMPLETE!***
* ~~Re-implement the communicator sprites i've made for it.~~ **_COMPLETE!_**
* Begin modifying other sprites (In progress)
* Begin work on custom levels (In progress)
* Implement the Eclipse, Axl's ship, which will appear in the _**animation..**_
* Make new models (need help with this too...)
* Modify the music, or the character voices
* ~~Begin work on custom dialogue to match the character's personality~~ **_COMPLETE!_**
* _Edit the cutscenes, hopefully modify the Nintendo Presents text to say Axl / Nintendo Presents or something (In Progress, 1/2 complete)_ 


# Special Thanks:
* Nintendo and Argonaut Software: For the creation of the SuperFX chip, and the Star Fox series
* Sunlitspace542: Providing the UltraStarfox source code for people to start making ROM Hacks easier!
* The Star Fox EX team: For helping me with some (Most probably most XD) of the modifications to the source code
