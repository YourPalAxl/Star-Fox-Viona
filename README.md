# Star-Fox-Viona
A WIP ROM Hack of Star Fox for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. All Star Fox copyrights still go to Nintendo!

** /!\ WARNING: THIS ROM HACK FEATURES MY OCs! DON'T STEAL THEM! /!\ **

If you have been following me for the past month or so, you may have noticed i've gotten to like Star Fox.
I'm currently working on a ROM Hack for the SNES Version of the game, which will replace Fox and friends (and their dialogue) with some of my original characters. I'll try to make it in-line with my upcoming animation "Airborne"

This repository will NOT contain any distrubution of the Star Fox ROM, or the necessary MS-DOS applications needed for compilation.
I don't want to have a boss fight with Nintendo.

# Current Characters

-Axl:
Axl is a very friendly wolf with a liking for retro stuff, and cuddles... He has a strong sense of what's right, and what's wrong!

-Justine:
Justine is a white cat who has been at Axl's side since those... dark days... Her and Axl's friendship is very strong! She is very caring as a person, she'll not leave your side if she catches you being upset.

-Mallow:
Mallow is the most peculiar of the bunch... Mallow is a fox... made entirely out of marshmallow slime..  Axl is commonly teased over this. Don't let this scare you though! She's not some 80s horror movie monster. She's actaully the glue of the team. If you're worried about her ship, don't worry! It's been modified so it keeps as it's top performance, no matter where her goo ends up in it!


# Requirements for compilation:
Please make sure you've got the following:
* A computer running MS-DOS 5.00 (You may try running the programs in other versions of MS-DOS, but i can't guarantee stability, as i've not tested this.)
* Argonaut Software's compiler software (This is not provided for legality reasons.)
* An SNES or at least an emulator. (This will create an SNES .SFC ROM upon successful compilation. You may get a checksum error. this is totally normal!)

# To-Do:
* ~~Implement the crosshair view seen in the asteroid levels fully across all levels, replacing the view you can switch to by pressing SELECT~~ ***COMPLETE!***
* ~~Implement a modification to the SuperFX "Chip" which gifts the game with a groundbreaking 30FPS!!~~ ***COMPLETE!***
* Re-implement the communicator sprites i've made for it.
* Begin modifying other sprites (I need help with this too)
* Begin work on custom levels (I have no idea how to do this, please contact me to help if you can!)
* Implement the Eclipse, Axl's ship, which will appear in airborne
* Make new models (need help with this too...)
* Modify the music, or the character voices
* Begin work on custom dialogue to match the character's personality (In progress)
* Edit the cutscenes, hopefully modify the Nintendo Presents text to say Axl / Nintendo Presents or something


# Special Thanks:
* Nintendo and Argonaut Software: For the creation of the SuperFX chip, and the Star Fox series
* Sunlitspace542: Providing the source code for people to start making ROM Hacks easier!
