why do we all have to wear these ridiculous ties?
Hello there
Weren't you supposed to be in the test chamber half an hour ago?
Good morning, Gordon
Absolutely Not
I can't be bothered right now
You'll just have to wait until after the test
as i expected
Wouldn't you like to get one of these blood samples under a microscope? 
Big day today, freeman
*scream*
Oh my god, we're doomed!
Don't let it overcharge
What do you mean "overcharge"?
Freeman, you fool! 
Do you know who ate all the donuts?
 	Someone has hidden my glasses again
I predicted all of this, you know. All of it!
